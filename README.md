# READ-TST300V2-TEMP.-and-HUMI.-sensors-data-read-using-Modbus-Master-Simulation
Read TST300 V2 temperature and humidity sensor data read using Modbus Master simulation and 
sending those data to Ubidots.

1.Read Temperature sensor data:

ïƒ˜	At beginning we must identify which port we will use in our laptop. Then, we need to go in my devices application server to figure out this. 

ïƒ˜	Download Modbus master simulation below links,

ïƒ˜	For reading data from devices, at first, we must setup device settings by simulation.

ïƒ˜	Device ID:1, Holding resister, Address-100, Length-2

2.Humedity sensor data read:

ïƒ˜	Setup device settings 

ïƒ˜	Device ID:3, Holding resister, Address-102, Length-2

3.Read data from meter:

ïƒ˜	Setup device settings:

ïƒ˜	Device ID:2, Input Resister, Address-0, Length-1

4.Modbus RTU setting:

ïƒ˜	Port- COM5

ïƒ˜	Bitrate-19200

ïƒ˜	Parity-Even

ïƒ˜	Stop Bit-1

5.Those data send to Node-red: Temperature sensor RTU settings:

6.Meter data read by node-red:

ïƒ˜	Set function node:

7.Those data send to Node-red: Humidity sensor:

8.Simens IOT2040 Connection:

ïƒ˜	Open the IoT2040 then remove memory card.

ïƒ˜	Flash the memory card by SD card format with PC.

ïƒ˜	Download the IOT-2040 Image from SIEMENSE web site. To download image, we need to open an account and login to this site.

ïƒ˜	After that IOT-2040 image install our memory card using BalenaEatcher application.

ïƒ˜	Now set everything.

ïƒ˜	Then we connect IoT2040 by putty. It has default IP-192.168.200.1

Login-root

Password-passwd.

ïƒ˜	Type (iot2000setup) for entry the device.

ïƒ˜	Both computer IP and device IP will be same otherwise putty will not be able for communication.

ïƒ˜Enter the software to active Node-red. If IoT connected with our Computer, then we can use default IP-192.168.200.1 for login Node-red. If we donâ€™t change it.

ïƒ˜	If our IoT connect with our router by port-eth1, then it will take a different IP. That time we must use different IP for login Node-red.

ïƒ˜	For this we can login our router then search (sub mask number) which provide Simians on this device.
